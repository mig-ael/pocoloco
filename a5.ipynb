    "\n",
    "At the start of the round, the order of the players is shuffled randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The starting player for the round rolls all three dice one, two, or three times,\n",
    "trying to get the highest possible score (see below). After any roll they can\n",
    "stop. If it's their third roll, they must stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dice rolls are ranked using this table, ordered from best (at the top) to worst\n",
    "(at the bottom):\n",
    "\n",
    "- PoCo!; 4, 5, 6\n",
    "- Three-of-a-kind: 6, 6, 6 or 5, 5, 5 or 4, 4, 4 or 3, 3, 3 or 2, 2, 2 or 1, 1, 1\n",

    "\n",
    "4, 5, 6 is is called a PoCo! and is the best possible roll. The next best are\n",
    "three-of-a-kinds: 6, 6, 6 is the best three-of-kind, followed by 5, 5, 5, and so\n",
    "on down to 1, 1, 1. A roll of 1, 2, 3 is called a Loco! and is the next best\n",
    "roll after 1, 1, 1. Note that these eight particular rolls don't get a score\n",
    "directly, but instead they are used to determine how many chips the\n",
    "lowest-scoring player gets at the end of the round (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the score of a roll that's not PoCo!, Loco!, or three-of-a-kind,\n",
    "you sum the numbers on the face of each die using these values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 = 100 points\n",
    "- 2 = 2 points\n",
    "- 3 = 3 points\n",
    "- 4 = 4 points\n",
    "- 5 = 5 points\n",
    "- 6 = 60 points\n",

    "For example, if you roll 1, 4, 6, then you score $100 + 4 + 60 = 164$ points. If\n",
    "you roll 2, 4, 4, you score $2 + 4 + 4 = 10$ points.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a player's turn is done, the next player rolls. Within a round, the next\n",
    "player can, at most, roll as many times as the player before them. For example,\n",
    "if the player before them rolled the dice once and then stopped, then they can\n",
    "only roll once. When a new round starts then the first player can roll up to\n",
    "three times.\n",
    "\n",
    "After everyone has had their turn, the player with the highest scoring roll and\n",
    "lowest scoring roll are determined. Then everyone, except the lowest-scoring\n",
    "player, gives chips **to the lowest-scoring player** as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 chip if the winners score is a points total\n",
    "- 2 chips if the winners score is 1, 2, 3 (Loco!)\n",
    "- 3 chips if the winners score is any three-of-a-kind\n",
    "- 4 chips if the winners score is 4, 5, 6 (PoCo!)\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, if a player has no chips, then they win and the game is over. If all\n",
    "players have at least 1 chip, then another round is played. Rounds keep being played\n",
