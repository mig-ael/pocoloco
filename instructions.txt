### OVERVIEW

PocoLoco is a dice-rolling game played with chips. PocoLoco is played in rounds.
In each round, players take turns rolling three dice and try to get the highest score possible. After all the players have taken their turn in a round, the lowest-scoring player is given chips from the other players.
The game ends when a player loses all their chips. The first player with zero
chips is the winner. Eg: Similar to how losing all your cards in UNO is a win.

### GAMEPLAY

Each player starts with 10 chips. If you want a longer game, you can start with more
chips. If you want a shorter game, use fewer chips.

At the start of the round, the order of the players is shuffled randomly.

The starting player for the round rolls all three dice. Then, they have to choice to reroll all, 1, or 2 dice
trying to get the highest possible score. They can re-roll up to two times.

When a player's turn is done, the next player rolls. Within a round, the next
player can only roll as many times as the player before them.
Eg: If the order is P1,P2,P3,P4 and P1 decides to roll only once, the succeeding players can only roll once.
When a new round starts then the first player can roll up to three times.

### SCORING SYSTEM

Dice rolls are ranked using this table, ordered from best (at the top) to worst
(at the bottom):

- PoCo!: 4, 5, 6
- Three-of-a-kind:
	6, 6, 6
	5, 5, 5
	4, 4, 4
	3, 3, 3
	2, 2, 2
	1, 1, 1
- Loco!: 1, 2, 3
- every other roll is ranked according to the dice score, as explained below

To calculate the score of a roll that's not PoCo!, Loco!, or three-of-a-kind,
you sum the numbers on the face of each die using these values:

- 1 = 100 points
- 2 = 2 points
- 3 = 3 points
- 4 = 4 points
- 5 = 5 points
- 6 = 60 points

For example, if you roll 1, 4, 6, then you score 100 + 4 + 60 = 164 points.


After everyone has had their turn, the player with the highest scoring roll and
lowest scoring roll are determined. Then everyone, except the lowest-scoring
player, gives chips **to the lowest-scoring player** as follows:

- 1 chip if the winners score is a points total
- 2 chips if the winners score is 1, 2, 3 (Loco!)
- 3 chips if the winners score is any three-of-a-kind
- 4 chips if the winners score is 4, 5, 6 (PoCo!)

After this, if a player has no chips, then they win and the game is over. Rounds keep being played
until there is a winner.


### TIE BREAKING

When determining a round's highest and lowest scoring players, it's possible that there could be ties.
In that case, the computer will choose a random winner/loser.
Eg: If both P1 AND P2 tie as winners with 222 points, then the program will randomly decide a winner
between P1 AND P2 using python's built-in random.choice() function.
